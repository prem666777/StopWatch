# Stopwatch Application

## Description
This is a simple Java-based Stopwatch application built using `Swing` for the graphical user interface (GUI). The application allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer. The time is displayed in the format `HH:MM:SS`.

## Features
- **Start/Stop Timer:** Toggle the timer between running and stopped.
- **Reset Timer:** Reset the timer back to `00:00:00`.
- **Simple GUI:** An intuitive interface with buttons to control the stopwatch.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

## Installation
1. Ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can check the version by running:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
2. Download or clone the repository containing the `StopWatch.java` file.
3. Compile the Java file using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac StopWatch.java
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   java StopWatch
   ```

## Usage
- **Start/Stop Timer:**
  - Click the "Start" button to begin the timer.
  - Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer.
  
- **Reset Timer:**
  - Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer back to `00:00:00`.

## Code Overview
- **Global Variables:**
  - `JFrame`: The main frame of the application.
  - `JButton`: Buttons for starting/stopping and resetting the timer.
  - `JLabel`: Label to display the elapsed time.
  - `Timer`: A timer to trigger events every second (1000 milliseconds).

- **Constructor `StopWatch`:** Initializes the GUI components and sets up the frame.

- **`actionPerformed` Method:** Handles button clicks to start/stop or reset the timer.

- **`start`, `stop`, and `reset` Methods:** Control the behavior of the timer based on user interaction.

## GUI Components
- **Time Label (`JLabel`):** Displays the elapsed time in the format `HH:MM:SS`.
- **Start Button (`JButton`):** Starts or stops the timer.
- **Reset Button (`JButton`):** Resets the timer to `00:00:00`.

## Customization
- **Font and Colors:** Modify the `Font` and other properties like background color or button sizes in the constructor to customize the appearance.
